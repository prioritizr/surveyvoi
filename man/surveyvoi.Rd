\title{surveyvoi: Survey Value of Information}
\description{
Decision support tool for prioritizing sites for ecological
surveys based on their potential to improve plans for conserving
biodiversity (e.g. plans for establishing protected areas). Given a set of
sites that could potentially be acquired for conservation management --
wherein some sites have previously been surveyed and other sites have not
-- it can be used to generate and evaluate plans for
additional surveys. Specifically, plans for ecological surveys can be
generated using various conventional approaches (e.g. maximizing expected
species richness, geographic coverage, diversity of sampled environmental
conditions) and by maximizing value of information. After generating
plans for surveys, they can also be evaluated using
value of information analysis.

\details{
Please note that several functions depend on
the 'Gurobi' optimization software (available from \url{https://www.gurobi.com})
and the \pkg{gurobi} R package (installation instructions
\href{https://support.gurobi.com/hc/en-us/articles/4534161999889-How-do-I-install-Gurobi-Optimizer}{available online for Linux, Windows, and Mac OS}).
Additionally, the JAGS software
(available from \url{https://mcmc-jags.sourceforge.io/}) is required to fit
hierarchical generalized linear models.

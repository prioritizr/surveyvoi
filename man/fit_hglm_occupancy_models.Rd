\description{
Estimate probability of occupancy for a set of features in a set of
planning units. Models are fitted as hierarchical generalized linear models
that account for for imperfect detection (following Royle & Link 2006)
using JAGS (via \code{\link[runjags]{run.jags}}). To limit over-fitting,
spike-and-slab coefficients are used
to perform stochastic search variable selection (Kuo & Mallick 1998).
}
\details{
This function (i) prepares the data for model fitting,
 (ii) fits the models, and (iii) assesses the performance of the
  models. These analyses are performed separately for each
 feature. For a given feature:

 \enumerate{

 \item The data are prepared for model fitting by partitioning the data using
 k-fold cross-validation (set via argument to \code{n_folds}). The
 training and evaluation folds are constructed
 in such a manner as to ensure that each training and evaluation
 fold contains at least one presence and one absence observation.

 \item A model for fit separately for each fold (see
 \code{inst/jags/model.jags} for model code). To assess convergence,
 the multi-variate potential scale reduction factor
 (MPSRF) statistic is calculated for each model.

 \item The performance of the cross-validation models is evaluated.
 Specifically, the TSS, sensitivity, and specificity statistics are
 calculated (if relevant, weighted by the argument to
 \code{site_weights_data}). These performance values are calculated using
 the models' training and evaluation folds. To assess convergence,
 the maximum MPSRF statistic for the models fit for each feature
 is calculated.
